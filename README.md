Door management resource, with compatibility for [ox_core](https://github.com/communityox/ox_core), [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core), [es_extended](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core), [nd_core](https://github.com/ND-Framework/ND_Core), and [qbox](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core).  
Successor to nui_doorlock with less scuff and more stuff.
